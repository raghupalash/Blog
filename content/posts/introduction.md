Hello world!

I'm Palash Singh Raghuwanshi, a Software Engineer, currently working at a Fintech company. I also have some experience teaching Python to college students.

This website aims to be a collection of my learnings - technical and otherwise. As well as other cool stuff I come across.

So if you're interested in what I have to say, stick around!

I'm glad you came.
